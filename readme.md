# 📊 AI-Powered Clustering App using K-Means, GA, and QGA

This is an interactive **Streamlit-based web application** that allows users to perform clustering using:

- ✅ Classical K-Means  
- 🧬 Genetic Algorithm–based K-Means  
- ⚛️ Quantum-Inspired Genetic Algorithm–based K-Means  

The goal is to **compare how different intelligent optimization techniques perform clustering** on your own datasets in terms of accuracy and performance.

## 🛠️ Installation & Launch

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mdzubair9492/Quantum-Inspired-and-Evolutionary-Clustering-Comparison-App.git
    cd ai-clustering-app
    ```

2. **Create & Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    # Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install Required Packages**

    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Your `requirements.txt` should include:

    ```text
    streamlit
    numpy
    pandas
    scikit-learn
    matplotlib
    altair
    ```

4. **Launch the Streamlit App**

    ```bash
    streamlit run streamlit_app.py
    ```

    Once running, open your browser to the printed Local URL (e.g. `http://localhost:8501`).
